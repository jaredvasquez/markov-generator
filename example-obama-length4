So, take note, gentlemen.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


I happen to be one of them.


And we brought that to Iowa.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I may have.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to thank you.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And what the protectors of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long.


And the accommodations were a little different.


We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


We understand that.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same rules?


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


They say, Ready to go.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


We're not done yet on this journey.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions trying to stop us.


I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


We're going to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And I wanted a President who was smart.


I've got to turn out the vote.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


I knew he could be that President.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


It's not always a smooth path.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote.


But those were tough fights.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


A powerful reminder of this myself on our last campaign.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


And I said, What?


A former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


Tomorrow, from the granite of New Hampshire to the Rockies of Colorado, from the coastlines of Florida to Virginia's rolling hills, from the valleys of Ohio to these Iowa fields we will keep America moving forward.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


We cannot be stopped.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


So I start joining in the chant.


I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


And if you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're Democrats, or Republicans, or independents the kind of Iowa leaders you've always had and Christie Vilsack, and Tom Harkin, and Leonard Boswell and Bruce Braley, and my great friends, Tom Miller and Mike Fitzgerald.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


That's why we pushed for it.


And, Iowa, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I may have.


That's what it's called.


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


And if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


And, Iowa, you taught me to bet on you.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


Mitt is his middle name.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


Now, the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties.


This is true.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


I took office.


Tomorrow, all across this state, all across this state, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


So why would you give him his vote?


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


That's where we need to go forward.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States Barack Obama.


God bless you.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


I've got work to do.


I first showed up in Iowa.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


Ready to go!


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


And, by the way for all the young people out here, Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


I wasn't this gray when I first showed up in Iowa.


It's one that we've got to fight for.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home.


Governor Romney and I will have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


And more than anything else, I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


And we kept on going.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


So we may have different political perspectives, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


We believe in a generous America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


This is a family issue.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the fight.


And if it can change a city.


Everyone, please take your seats otherwise Clint Eastwood will yell at them.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


I don't know what's going on.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


A young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


They'd say, We're fired up.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq, and we did.


I'm dragging my bags to my room.


We will win Virginia again.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


That's what we believe.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


We said, why don't you come on up?


I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


And the accommodations were a little different.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the grip of foreign oil.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating.


Now, this extends to other issues.


God bless these United States.


When we had a Steak Fry to march to, when we had a j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


I'm not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the road blocks that stand in our path.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to stand with me, and knock on some doors.


I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


And tonight, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


Nice to meet you.


I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina.


It makes a difference.


To make sure your voices are heard.


That's not a deal I will make.


So why would you give him his vote?


I signed into office.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


Thank you so much.


We got every dime back from the banks that we used to rescue those banks.


I met her at some function where nobody knew me, nobody could pronounce my name.


Thank you very much.


I've got to turn out the vote.


I'm looking around.


This is an economic issue.


That's what it's called.


In our hearts that for the United States of America.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


But, Iowa, you taught me to bet on hope.


I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


Don't let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference.


And I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


And I knew that I wanted a President who was smart.


America is the greatest nation on earth.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


I'll work with anybody, of any party, to move this country forward.


And, by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


And we said, why don't you come on up?


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


That's why we're not done.


In poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


And we've seen over the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


He has just been tremendous.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq, and we did.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


I was describing Barack.


Four more years!


I ran because your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work you might have Romnesia.


Tomorrow, all across this state, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


If he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance, you wouldn't give him a dime.


And, Iowa, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


We cannot be stopped.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


I'm so proud to lead as your president.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


I don't have a joke here.


I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


So, take note, gentlemen.


Where's that pep in your step?


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


And the accommodations were a little different.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


And we will do it.


You know I tell the truth.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


It moves forward because of you.


Home values are on the rise.


That's who we are.


Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


I felt good.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


It's out of my hands now.


The New York Times.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


They'd say, We're fired up.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


To make sure their voices are heard.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you ready to go?


And I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


That's the vision we share.


I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


But all of you are family.


I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


And I knew that I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


We've got more work to do.


And we will do it.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


God bless these United States.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


But I tell you what, you know what I believe.


I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


This is true.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


And I wanted a President who was smart.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


And I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


We have been there.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States Barack Obama.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


I tell you what, you know what I believe.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


I happen to be one of them.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


God bless you.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the fight.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


I'm not making this up.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


God bless your families.


I tell you what, you know what I believe.


It's out of my hands now.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign.


He needs a champion.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


Nothing like it.


This is my meeting.


We cannot be stopped.


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


And if it can change a city.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


It makes a difference.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


I went to school here in New York, had a wonderful experience here.


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


And this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in 2008.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


And if you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're Democrats, or Republicans, or independents the kind of Iowa leaders you've always had and Christie Vilsack, and Tom Harkin, and Leonard Boswell and Bruce Braley, and my great friends, Tom Miller and Mike Fitzgerald.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


We can't go back to that.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


That's why we're not done.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


No, no, listen to this.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you ready to go?


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess.


I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


And it shouldn't.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


Freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


I hear the voice Fired up.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


To make sure your voices are heard.


It's one that we've got to fight for.


God bless these United States.


You don't want that guy.


And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


God bless you.


Manufacturing is coming home.


Manufacturing is coming home.


I think that's what he's going through.


That's why we pushed for it.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


They'll always have access and influence.


We've made real progress these past four years.


That's why we pushed for it.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


This is my meeting.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


She does it wherever she goes.


Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


That's not bipartisanship.


I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


But we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has with that determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together.


It's out of my hands now.


I was a senator back then.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


I have met recently.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


God bless you.


And if you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're Democrats, or Republicans, or independents the kind of Iowa leaders you've always had and Christie Vilsack, and Tom Harkin, and Leonard Boswell and Bruce Braley, and my great friends, Tom Miller and Mike Fitzgerald.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


Now, this extends to other issues.


God bless the United States of America.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.


You said, Yes, we can.


I need you, Iowa.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like, no matter where you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from or what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


That's what we believe.


This is an economic issue.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


I gave him a stroke.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


It makes a difference.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


Nice to meet you.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


I'm trying to make Axelrod sweat a little bit.


I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


We're not done yet on this journey.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


It's out of my hands now.


Thank you so much.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


He's been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy.


That's the agenda we need.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


And we know what our future requires.


I'm so proud of my husband.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


But I'm running for President.


I first showed up in Iowa.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us rich.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


When Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


This is true.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.


Ready to go!


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


And, by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


And I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


Eighteen days, Virginia.


This should be a no brainer.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


I said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11, and we have.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


And we will do it.


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


They don't know what to do.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


It's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names.


This is an economic issue also.


The people of Iowa understand that.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


We're going to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


We can't go back to that.


Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown.


And this isn't just a women's issue.


That's what we fight for.


You held caucus trainings.


That's why we do this.


Nice to meet you.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


I came back to ask you to help us finish what we've started.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


I'll ever do for me.


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


And I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


That's the principle we were founded on.


I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests.


Our fight for change goes on.


I hear the voice Fired up.


The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since I took office.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


It makes a difference.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


But I tell you what, you know what I believe.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


It's not always a smooth path.


And I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


That's the agenda we need.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


That's who we are.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


We've got more road to travel.


That's where we need to go.


I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews.


We said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


I don't know what's going on.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


I mean, as you know this is a pretty emotional time for us, because this is the final event of my husband's final campaign.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


Are you fired up?


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


One voice can change a room, it can change a city, it can change a state.


I have never been more hopeful about America.


Now, this extends to other issues.


Let me say this publicly.


And tonight, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


And you've made me a better president.


When the heat didn't work for the first week or so some of you brought hats and gloves for the staff.


I could use my middle name.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


They'd say, We're fired up.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


I want every child to have the same chance at a great education where we recruit new teachers, train new workers, bring down tuition, so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education.


To make sure your voices are heard.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to thank you all for being here tonight.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


So why would you give him his vote?


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


I ran because your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


And she said, I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


Four more years!


America fall in love with you too as our nation's first lady.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


He can't tell you.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


And this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in 2008.


America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


I won't pay that price.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


And it shouldn't.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


We've got the scars to prove it.


We said, why don't you come on up?


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


It's not always a straight line.


We can't go back to that.


I'm running for President.


We've got to keep moving forward.


I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


Ready to go.


Al Qaeda is on the run.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


Four more years!


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


So I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


When the heat didn't work for the first week or so some of you brought hats and gloves for the staff.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


A lot of tall buildings around.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


And I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


We know what real change looks like.


Are we going to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


That's what it's called.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a five point plan.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


And what the protectors of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


They'll always have access and influence.


And so we drive, and we drive, and we drive.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to still stand with me tomorrow, if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


Turns out she's a city councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


And, Iowa, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


And I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


That's what politics can be.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


It moves forward because of you.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


You know I tell the truth.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


It's out of my hands now.


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


Governor Cuomo; Mayor Bloomberg; Senator Schumer; all the distinguished guests who are here.


And so once again, I hear the voice Fired up.


So I start joining in the chant.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


We have tried it.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue.


We will win Virginia again.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


Because our budget reflects our priorities and our values.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


They say, Ready to go!


There may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change.


I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


We have our own opinions.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


We get to the hotel about 1 o'clock in the morning.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I have met recently.


We can't go back to that.


This is true.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


It's in yours.


And, Iowa, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


God bless your families.


She's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


I may have.


Are we going to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


The only person who should decide about your health care is you.


And you've made me a better president.


Assembly lines are humming again.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


I'd say, Are you fired up?


This is true.


America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the grip of foreign oil.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


And the accommodations were a little different.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


And I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what you look like, no matter where you are, no matter what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


And you know what Edith said?


I gave him a stroke.


I sure don't think any politician should decide.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


It's not small, it's big.


And she's dominating the room.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job, or a roof over their heads when they come home.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


Nice to meet you.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


I'll ever do for me.


I knew that I wanted a President who was smart.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


They'll always have access and influence.


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


I wish I could use my middle name.


A place for everybody.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


You'll give up on the fight.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


I don't think your insurance company gets to decide what care you should get.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


And you picked us up when we needed a lift.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


And I look at my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


And we brought that to Iowa.


We will win Virginia again.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


I'm so proud to lead as your president.


I wanted to lead our country.


That's what it's called.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


You held caucus trainings.


Nothing like it.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


That's not change.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


Let me say this publicly.


Thank you very much.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


I hope everybody is aware of that.


One voice can change a room.


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to keep believing in me.


I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


I meet on the campaign trail every day.


So I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


Eighteen days, Virginia.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


That's why we pushed for it.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Nice to meet you.


We'll finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


They say, Ready to go.


That's not bipartisanship.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go!


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


Are you ready to go?


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


And this isn't just a women's issue.


When we had a Steak Fry to march to, when we had a j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock, resolve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.


And I have so many fond memories of this state the house parties in Sioux City and Cedar Rapids; celebrating Malia's birthday in Pella; and seeing my husband's face carved in butter.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


We're going to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


God bless you.


Now, this extends to other issues.


Four more years!


I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


We've got to keep moving forward.


Nothing like it.


That's what makes America great.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


I'm just kidding I'm trying to make Axelrod sweat a little bit.


I hope everybody is aware of that.


And you're going to have a very big choice to make not just a choice between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it.


That's what change looks like.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


And so once again, I hear the voice Fired up.


And if it can change a room, it can change the world.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


God bless your families.


It's not always a smooth path.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


And if you're willing to try.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


I've never been more hopeful about our future.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


And that's why we've come too far to turn back now.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


God bless these United States.


But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And she said, I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


And tonight, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about America.


Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


I'm ready to go.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go!


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


And you've made me a better president.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


And she's dominating the room.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


They'd say, We're fired up.


I don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas; I want to reward companies that create jobs right here in Virginia, right here in America.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


That's why we pushed for it.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


I wanted a President who was smart.


In the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


I've come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best the best ever some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


Ready to go!


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


A foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


Against all odds, we did.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


We've got more work to do.


I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


And I knew that I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


That's who we are.


I felt really well rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


She's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long.


I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


God bless you.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


They don't know what to do.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


I asked her for her endorsement.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


I have to admit some things have changed since then.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


We will win Virginia again.


We got bin Laden.


I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


She does it wherever she goes.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


And it shouldn't.


By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock, resolve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from or what you look like or where we come from or who we love.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


We've made real progress these past four years, our family has been truly blessed to have all of you by his side as we have worked together to bring that change we can believe in.


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his.


I am wiped out.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started.


It moves forward because of you.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


And the accommodations were a little different.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


I'm asking for your vote.


Are you ready to go?


Moving this country forward begins with you.


That's the agenda you need.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


And we kept on going.


We got bin Laden.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the grip of foreign oil.


That's who we are.


We understand that.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


Our fight for change goes on.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


I don't have time just to be talking about it.


Nice to meet you.


God bless the United States of America.


And you picked us up when we needed a lift.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


And you picked us up when we needed a lift.


These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.


Now, the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make is not just between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


But there's some principles you got to fight for.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


Thank you, America.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.


I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.


But all of you are family.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


He can't tell you.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


To make sure your voices are heard.


And this isn't just a women's issue.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the grip of foreign oil.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you ready to go?


I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


I'm trying to drink it all in.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion.


I'm not just talking about changing parties.


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


America's never been about what can be done by us together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government.


This is my meeting.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way, we have to fix that.


We've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best the best ever some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.


And we called up Edith Childs.


I'd say, Are you ready to go?


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


For example, I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift.


So why would you give him his vote?


Thank you very much.


And the woman, her name was Edith Childs she became a celebrity, and she was written up in The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


They'll always have access and influence.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


You don't want that guy.


And during our rallies, this became a chant, and we'd have signs saying Fired up, Ready to go.


So, Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


The war in Afghanistan is ending.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


The people of Iowa understand that.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


Nothing like it.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


I knew that I wanted a President who was smart.


Thank you very much.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


It's not always a straight line.


Thank you so much.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


And we called up Edith Childs.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


This is my meeting.


So I start joining in the chant.


Al Smith Dinner.


Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long.


America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is playing by the same rules.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


It moves forward because of you.


But I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


They say, Fired up.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


Even his own running mate said he's kind of a throwback to the '50s.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Let me say this publicly.


You taught me to bet on you.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us strong.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


And you're going to have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


We are moving forward.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


Are you fired up?


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


A choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


He does smile when he says it, though.


They say, Ready to go.


We'll finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


No, no, listen to this.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


I've got the gray hair to show it.


And this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in 2008.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since I took office.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


I wish I could use my middle name.


And, Iowa, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


Thank you so much.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


And we've seen over the last four years.


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


I say, How do you do?


We have our own opinions.


Because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform, the war in Iraq.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


Now, this extends to other issues.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


And what the protectors of the status quo in Washington, they are powerful and they have fought us every step of the way.


And I am so proud of you guys.


One voice can change a room, it can change a room.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.


These poor kids, they weren't prepared.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


I'm asking for your vote.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


And we kept on going.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


And I'd see my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


When we had calls to make, teachers and nurses showed up after work, already bone tired, but staying anyway, late into the night.


I believe in you.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


And if it can change a state, it can change a nation, it can change a state.


We have our own opinions.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


And I'm making my way around the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


I have seen this spirit at work in America.


Even his own running mate said he's kind of a throwback to the '50s.


Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


Manufacturing is coming home.


And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


I was just inside, and it brought back a whole lot of time interrupting each other.


That's why we pushed for it.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


That's why elections matter.


I'm not just talking about changing parties.


And it shouldn't.


We've got to keep moving forward.


That's what politics can be.


That's what change is, Iowa.


And if it can change a room.


I first showed up in Iowa.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


And we brought that to Iowa.


But all of you are family.


God bless you.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


I need you, Iowa.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


We've got the scars to prove it.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


After losing 800, 000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


Thank you so much.


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


A seat at the table.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


And so once again, I hear the voice Fired up.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


Home values are on the rise.


So why would you give him his vote?


This should be a no brainer.


That's where we need to go.


The Boss in person.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


That's where we need to go.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


I've made Michelle doesn't.


Virginia, right here in America.


This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home.


And I want to take this opportunity to say one thing to all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank you all for being here tonight.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


We've got more road to travel.


He has just been tremendous.


After losing 800, 000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


And that's why we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


It's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


Now, this extends to other issues.


I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


Now suddenly he's saying, what, who, me?


We'll finish what we started here in Iowa.


You don't want that guy.


I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


That's what we believe.


We can't go back to that.


Michelle, I have never loved you more.


And that's why we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


To make sure your voices are heard.


That's why elections matter.


Thank you, America.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


We're going to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


It's one that we've got to fight for.


Why should this be hard?


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


Our economy is recovering.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


But those were tough fights.


We got bin Laden.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


I tell the truth.


The New York Times.


I have listened to you.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


This is my meeting.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


I mean, gosh.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


He needs a champion.


The American auto industry is back.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


That's what politics can be.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


Moving this country forward begins with you.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to stand with me, and make some phone calls with me, and make some phone calls with me, and knock on some doors with, get your friends to vote for me we will win Fairfax County again.


I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


Where's that pep in your step?


An economist at the New York Times put it this morning, There's no jobs plan there's just a snow job on the American people.


And, by the way for all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years.


That's not just a health issue, it's an economic issue.


That's the agenda you need.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions trying to stop us.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


Now, the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to keep believing in me.


And you're going to have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


It's not small, it's big.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


That's what it's called.


I sure don't think any politician should decide.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


And if it can change a nation, it can change a state.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.


And we've seen over the last four years.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


That's what it's called.


And we go to our next stop, and for the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace, even though people still couldn't pronounce my name, I felt good.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way, we have to fix that.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


He can't tell you.


I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


You inspired us.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


I won't pay that price.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


It's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


Freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care, or denied affordable coverage just because you beat cancer.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


And if it can change a nation, it can change a nation.


I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And if you're willing to stand with me, and knock on some doors.


That's where we need to go.


We have tried it.


Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa headquarters in 2008.


We understand that.


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


I felt really well rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.


Against all odds, we did.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


This is my meeting.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


I've got the gray hair to show it.


I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


I've made Michelle doesn't.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


And may God bless the United States of America is the greatest nation on earth.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people.


That's the agenda we need.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


I've met too many good Americans who work so hard, show so much resilience, so much resolve we have been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating.


The American auto industry is back.


I don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas; I want to reward companies that create jobs right here in Virginia, right here in America.


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


God bless you.


You inspired us.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


And I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


You taught me to bet on hope.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


And I am so proud of you guys.


God bless the United States of America.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


It's not always a smooth path.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.


Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


And I'm making my way around the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


Ready to go!


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


That's where we need to go forward.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


I want to reward companies that create jobs right here in Virginia, right here in America.


I mean, he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping we've got to name this condition that he's going through.


I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


And we go to our next stop, and for the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace, even though people still couldn't pronounce my name, I felt good.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has lifted this country from the grip of foreign oil.


He told folks he was the ideal candidate for the Tea Party.


That's why elections matter.


I've got work to do.


Now, this extends to other issues.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.


I've never been more hopeful about America.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions trying to stop us.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


Are you fired up?


We got bin Laden.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


You'll give up on the fight.


Four more years!


God bless you.


Where's that golden smile?


If he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance, you wouldn't give him a dime.


A room, it can change a city, it can change a city, it can change a nation, it can change a nation.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


Home values are back on the rise.


Now, the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions trying to stop us.


We've got to keep moving forward.


That's why elections matter.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


But the truth is while I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


You'll give up on the fight.


They say, Ready to go!


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


In Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


Even his own running mate said he's kind of a throwback to the '50s.


I said we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


But I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


I've met too many good Americans who work so hard, show so much resilience, so much resolve we have been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


I think that's what he's going through.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


We have tried it.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


And we've seen over the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


I mean, gosh.


I don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas; I want to reward companies that create jobs right here in Virginia, right here in America.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


We can't go back to that.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


I know how.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


A bad story about me in The New York Times.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


That's why we do this.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


That's why we pushed for it.


When we had calls to make, teachers and nurses showed up after work, already bone tired, but staying anyway, late into the night.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


Against all odds, we did.


That's what we're fighting for.


It makes a difference.


And they're all kind of wet, too, and they don't look very excited to see me.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


The people who need a champion are the Americans whose letters I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


Can everybody please give Cecile a big round of applause for the great introduction and the work she does.


God bless your families.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Iraq is over.


If he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance, you wouldn't give him a dime.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


That's not bipartisanship.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


I'm so proud to lead as your president.


Thank you very much.


Why should this be hard?


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Iraq, and we did.


We've come too far to turn back now.


Al Qaeda is on the run.


We've got more work to do.


We've got the scars to prove it.


And what the protectors of the status quo in Washington, they are powerful and they have fought us every step of the way.


So for the next few minutes, she just keeps on saying Fired up.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


And may God bless the United States of America is the greatest nation on earth.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


The Boss in person.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


Are you for equal pay for equal work?


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq, and we did.


And we said, why don't you come on up?


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


And I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


She does it wherever she goes.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


I'm making my way around the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


I'm looking around.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


You held caucus trainings.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world.


And I knew that I wanted a President who was smart.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


God bless these United States.


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


I'm talking about changing our politics.


And we brought that to Iowa.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


It's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names.


That's where we need to go.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


They say, Ready to go.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


I've got the gray hair to show it.


I've come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote.


And this isn't just a women's issue.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


I said we'd end the war in Iraq, and we did.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


That's what change is, Iowa.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


And we've seen over the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


We can't go back.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


Michelle and I received.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


That's the agenda you need.


Sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


That's why elections matter.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


We have our own opinions.


That's what we fight for.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


I've got to turn out the vote.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


And I wanted a President who was smart.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


That's what makes America great.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


We can't go back to that.


We're going to have to wake up and be on the road at 6 30 a.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.


I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


We said, why don't you come on up?


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.


To Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs.


And we will do it.


Assembly lines are humming again.


Now, this extends to other issues.


That's why we do this.


The New York Times.


And if you're willing to try.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq is over.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


And we said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it.


I promise you, so have I.


We've got the scars to prove it.


The people who need a champion are the Americans whose letters I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


I need you to keep believing in me.


One voice can change a room.


A few minutes.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


That's the principle we were founded on.


Let me say this publicly.


And you've made me a better president.


What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


We can't go back.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


And we will do it.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


Ready to go.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


When Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


It's out of my hands now.


I know he's called him severely he's called himself severely conservative, but there's nothing conservative about a government that prevents a woman from making her own health care decisions.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


It's one that we've got to fight for.


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


It makes a difference.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same rules.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


But we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has with that determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together.


Mitt Romney is trying to give you a Sketchy Deal.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


Our fight for change goes on.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


And we called up Edith Childs.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


We'll finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


That's where we need to go forward.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us back to the failed economic policies of the past.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


That's what change looks like.


I wanted a President who was smart.


This should be a no brainer.


We've made real progress these past four years.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


And what the protectors of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


That's not change.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


We understand that.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign.


And what the protectors of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


This is a family issue.


I don't think your insurance company gets to decide what care you should get.


You held caucus trainings.


It's like getting the band back together again.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


There may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what we look like or where we come from or who we love.


That's what it's called.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


That's why we do this.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


It's like getting the band back together again.


But I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


And during our rallies, this became a chant, and we'd have signs saying Fired up, Ready to go!


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


And sometimes it's been hard.


And we go to our next stop, and for the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace, even though people still couldn't pronounce my name, I felt good.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


We understand that.


No, no, listen to this.


I was describing Barack.


Now suddenly he's saying, what, who, me?


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


I think a cold is coming on.


He does smile when he says it, though.


Manufacturing is coming home.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


Why should this be hard?


God bless you.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


He's been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy.


I don't think your insurance company gets to decide what care you should get.


And you know what Edith said?


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I have met recently.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


We've got to keep moving forward.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


That's the agenda you need.


Eighteen days, Virginia.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


And I said, What?


I'm so proud of my husband.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that no one who fights for this country's freedom should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


That's what it's called.


And if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


That's what change looks like.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


That's why I need you, Iowa.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


They'd say, We're fired up.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education that Michelle and I received.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


I need you to keep believing in me.


You held caucus trainings.


I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


He does smile when he says it, though.


And Barack has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


Thank you so much.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


Are you ready to go?


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


The single most powerful force in our democracy is you.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules?


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


And it brought back some great memories because, some of you know, I went to school here in New York, had a wonderful experience here.


We've made real progress these past four years.


But all of you are family.


We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


But we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has with that determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together.


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


It's not small, it's big.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


I don't hear a lot going on.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


It makes a difference.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


I came back to ask you to help us finish what we've started.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


I'm feeling kind of fired up.


A chant, and we'd have signs saying Fired up, Ready to go!


I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


Even his own running mate said he's kind of a throwback to the '50s.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote.


You said, Yes, we can and we did.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


You inspired us.


I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


He does smile when he says it, though.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


God bless you.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


And, Iowa, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


He has just been tremendous.


Ready to go!


So why would you give him his vote?


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


We'll finish what we started.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


Governor Romney wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


So why would you give him his vote?


But there's some principles you got to fight for.


She does it wherever she goes.


And if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started.


None of this will add to the deficit.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions trying to stop us.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


It's out of my hands now.


I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years.


I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


God bless you.


I've come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote.


A President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


It's not small, it's big.


In 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


We've got more work to do.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


I first showed up in Iowa.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change is.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


I used to talk about change.


But I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


We can't go back.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


I have met recently.


America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


I have learned from you.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


We will win Virginia again.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


That's where we need to go.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


Ready to go!


I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Home values are back on the rise.


That's what politics can be.


And if it can change a state, it can change a nation, it can change a city, it can change the world.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


So, take note, gentlemen.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


And I am so proud of you guys.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


But I'm running for President.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


I've never been more hopeful about our future.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


We've got to keep moving forward.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


And so we drive, and we drive.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


I think this office had just finally gotten the heat turned on.


And you picked us up when we needed a lift.


Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


No, no, listen to this.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


That's where we need to go forward.


I was just inside, and it brought back a whole lot of memories.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


We're fired up.


I'm running for President.


I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.


I'm ready to go.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I will have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


God bless you.


I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


That's not bipartisanship.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


Nothing like it.


In 2008, we were in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


You taught me to bet on you.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


And more than anything else, I want to thank you.


That's the agenda we need.


And I am so proud of you guys.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love.


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions trying to stop us.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


I've got work to do.


But I tell you what, you know what I believe.


He does smile when he says it, though.


America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


I have never loved you more.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


Al Smith Dinner.


That won't change after tonight.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win this election.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


A voting booth.


And I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


And I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


As long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


America if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


We've got to keep moving forward.


Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


That's one thing we agree on.


This is my meeting.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


They say, Ready to go!


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


He can't tell you.


And we go to our next stop, and for the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace, even though people still couldn't pronounce my name, I felt good.


I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


And you're going to have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


He has just been tremendous.


The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


It makes a difference.


And I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


And, Iowa, you taught me to bet on hope.


And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds.


They'd say, We're fired up.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


I am so proud of you guys.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education where we recruit new teachers, train new workers, bring down tuition, so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


I want to thank you.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work you might have Romnesia.


A state representative down there.


Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


That's the principle we were founded on.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq.


This is true.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


Four more years!


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what we look like or where we come from or who we love.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us rich.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


That's where we need to go.


That's who we are.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America is the greatest nation on earth.


That's why we do this.


Now, this extends to other issues.


And Barack has been truly blessed to have all of you by his side as we have worked together to bring that change we can believe in.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


That's why we're not done.


That's what we believe.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


And in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


It moves forward because of you.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no one who fights for this country's freedom should have to fight for a job, or a roof over their head when they come home.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


Tomorrow, from the granite of New Hampshire to the Rockies of Colorado, from the coastlines of Florida to Virginia's rolling hills, from the valleys of Ohio to these Iowa fields we will keep America moving forward.


God bless you.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


You held caucus trainings.


That's not bipartisanship.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


None of this will add to the deficit.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


We got bin Laden.


To make sure your voices are heard.


Four more years!


Ready to go.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


That's what makes America great.


I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


And if it can change a state.


I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


Nice to meet you.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


That's why I need you, Iowa.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


I sure don't think any politician should decide.


Tomorrow, all across this state, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


And I have so many fond memories of this state the house parties in Sioux City and Cedar Rapids; celebrating Malia's birthday in Pella; and seeing my husband's face carved in butter.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


So why would you give him his vote?


We've got more work to do.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


But Paul Ryan assured me that we've only been running for two hours and 50 something minutes.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his.


I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


I think it's called Romnesia.


After losing 800, 000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


I meet on the campaign trail every day.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


Virginia, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the Square Deal, the Fair Deal.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I have met recently.


And you've made me a better president.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


And this isn't just a women's issue.


I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


You said, Yes, we can.


He needs a champion.


I've got to knock on some doors.


You taught me to bet on hope.


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


That's what makes America great.


We've got to keep moving forward.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq is over.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


But those were tough fights.


And may God bless the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


They say, Fired up.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


And you know what Edith said?


And she said, I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


We've got to keep moving forward.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


I just spoke with Governor Romney and I may have.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion.


I want to use the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to pay down our deficit, put our people back to work right here, doing some nation building here at home.


I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


And so once again, I hear the voice Fired up.


I've got to knock on some doors with, get your friends to vote for me we will win Fairfax County again.


And, Iowa, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


But if you ever get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


Four more years!


We've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


We said, why don't you come on up?


I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


I've seen for the past 23 years.


Tomorrow, from the granite of New Hampshire to the Rockies of Colorado, from the coastlines of Florida to Virginia's rolling hills, from the valleys of Ohio to these Iowa fields we will keep America moving forward.


And I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.


The war in Afghanistan is ending.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


We got every dime back from the banks that we used to rescue those banks.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


He does smile when he says it, though.


I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


And we kept on going.


And, by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


It's not always a smooth path.


I set foot in the Oval Office.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change is.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


And she's dominating the room.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


I am so proud of you guys.


You know I tell the truth.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has lifted this country from the grip of foreign oil.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


Our fight for change goes on.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


We're going to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


We have tried it.


I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


Four more years!


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


But I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And it turns out that Greenwood is several hours away from everyplace else.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


We understand that.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


He can't tell you.


It's not always a straight line.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


And we said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


Nothing like it.


God bless you.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


And we said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


Virginia, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the Square Deal, the Fair Deal.


The restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand he's got great food but the bank turned him down he needs help.


Because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform, the war in Iraq is over.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


We know what real change is.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


For example, I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift.


Our fight for change goes on.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


That's why elections matter.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


Home values are back on the rise.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


That's what politics can be.


So we want to thank Bruce for everything that he's done for us.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


I set foot in the Oval Office.


I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


And that's why we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us strong.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


I've got to turn out the vote.


We got bin Laden.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


And may God bless the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


Mitt is his middle name.


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


Mitt is his middle name.


And if you're willing to still stand with me tomorrow, if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started here in Iowa.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I have met recently.


I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


I think it's called Romnesia.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to keep believing in me.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


I have to admit it can be a grind.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


God bless the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


In Iraq, and we did.


Four years after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


Because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform, the war in Iraq, and we did.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I have met recently.


So for the next few minutes, she just keeps on saying Fired up.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


I think it's called Romnesia.


I'm trying to drink it all in.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth.


And we will do it.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


We're ready to go.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


One voice can change a room.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


I'll ever do for me.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


And we know what our future requires.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


I think we were coming from Iowa.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


We've got more work to do.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


Now, the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make is not just between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


That's not bipartisanship.


The people of Iowa understand that.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


I'm not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the road blocks that stand in our path.


Ready to go.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Home values are back on the rise.


And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests.


I've got to knock on some doors.


These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


And you know what Edith said?


That's what change is, Iowa.


I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a very big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


The people who need a champion are the Americans whose letters I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


It's in yours.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunities and new security for the middle class.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


I'm not making this up.


And if it can change a nation, it can change the world.


More importantly, you opened your homes.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


That's what we're fighting for.


You taught me to bet on you.


That's not a deal I will make.


It's not always a straight line.


I think we were coming from Iowa.


And I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


A health issue, it's an economic issue.


This is the third time that Governor Romney and I will have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward.


After losing 800, 000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


And we kept on going.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


But I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


I won't pay that price.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


That's what we're fighting for.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to try.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


You know where I stand.


And, by the way for all the young people out here, Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


And, by the way for all the young people out here, Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


And I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


This is an economic issue.


I've got to turn out the vote.


And I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


Get him a little nervous.


Where's that pep in your step?


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


But it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace.


This is a family issue.


It's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


I could use my middle name.


They'd say, We're fired up.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


Nice to meet you.


That's what makes America great.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


Now, this extends to other issues.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


That's what change is, Iowa.


Ready to go!


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


So why would you give him his vote?


I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


So I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


I may have.


You said, Yes, we can and we did.


I have seen this spirit at work in America.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Where's that golden smile?


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


Our economy is recovering.


I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


So for the next few minutes, she just keeps on saying Fired up.


Now, this extends to other issues.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


And she's dominating the room.


We've got more work to do.


Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


I feel pretty good.


I want to hire more teachers in math and science, train 2 million workers at community colleges, bring down the cost of college tuition.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


This is an economic issue also.


Everyone, please take your seats otherwise Clint Eastwood will yell at them.


A buddy behind them watching their back.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


Thank you so much.


I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


So that's a big relief.


And you're going to have a very big choice to make not just a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


I've got the gray hair to show it.


Where's that golden smile?


And, Iowa, you taught me to bet on hope.


But it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace.


And I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


When we had calls to make, teachers and nurses showed up after work, already bone tired, but staying anyway, late into the night.


We're going to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


I want to finish the job.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


I hope everybody is aware of that.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


When Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue.


To make sure your voices are heard.


I met her at some function where nobody knew me, nobody could pronounce my name.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


We've got more work to do.


We get to the hotel about 1 o'clock in the morning.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


That's the principle we were founded on.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


Ready to go!


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


I promise you, so have I.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


You inspired us.


And we kept on going.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


She does it wherever she goes.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


That's what we believe.


Our economy is recovering.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other.


Now, the choice you make is not just between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


I know how.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


And I'm making my way around the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


I don't hear a lot going on.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


And I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


So we may have different political perspectives, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


That's what we fight for.


I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


We can't go back to that.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.


I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


And we kept on going.


I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


So, take note, gentlemen.


This is an economic issue also.


We know what real change looks like.


Governor Romney has got his sales pitch.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


We know what real change looks like.


The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


We have tried it.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


Ready to go!


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


This is my meeting.


Now, the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


That's where we need to go.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa headquarters in 2008.


Don't let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


We've got more work to do.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


I meet on the campaign trail every day.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


As long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


They don't know what to do.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


And Barack has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


Moving this country forward begins with you.


You know I tell the truth.


America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


But what we also know is that when we decide to make a difference, when Americans come together, determined to bring about change, nobody can stop us.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


Against all odds, we did.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


Are you for making sure that laws enforce that basic principle?


And we called up Edith Childs.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


He's been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy.


Thank you so much.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


That's what change looks like.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


I was so popular with our allies overseas.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


I visit cities and towns across our great country, and I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


And I'm thinking, this woman is showing me up.


That's why elections matter.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


And in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work?


We're not as cynical as the pundits believe.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


I have to admit it can be a grind.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can retire with dignit;, and our veterans, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


So we may have different political perspectives, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


That's what we're fighting for.


I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


And you picked us up when we needed a lift.


We're going to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


We've got the scars to prove it.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


You said, Yes, we can.


He does smile when he says it, though.


We can't go back.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.


We've got to keep moving forward.


When we had a Steak Fry to march to, when we had a j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


That's what we fight for.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


Because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform, the war in Iraq is over.


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


I will have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


They don't know what to do.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


We understand that.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


We have been there.


I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education where we recruit new teachers, train new workers, bring down tuition, so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education.


No, no, listen to this.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.


Are you ready to go?


If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


And the woman, her name was Edith Childs she became a celebrity, and she was written up in The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


They don't know what to do.


So, Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And I look at my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


When we had a Steak Fry to march to, when we had a j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like, no matter where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like, no matter where you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like or where we come from or who we love.


That's what we believe.


It's a choice between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


Our economy is recovering.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a five point plan.


Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make not just a choice between two candidates or parties.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


Our fight for change goes on.


That's what we're fighting for.


That's not a deal I will make.


We can't go back to that.


I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you ready to go?


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


And I'd see my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


And what the protectors of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


That's not bipartisanship.


Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


That's why I need you, Iowa.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first lady.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


You inspired us.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a very big choice to make not just a choice between two candidates or parties.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


But if you ever get the chance to finish what we started.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


We are moving forward.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


He can't tell you.


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I may have.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started here in Iowa.


I felt good.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to stand with me, and knock on some doors.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


We're going to have to wake up and be on the road at 6 30 a.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


We know what real change looks like.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


As long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


The New York Times.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change is.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


A bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


But I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


But the truth is while I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


A chance to make it if you try.


Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that's not what makes us rich.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


You know where I stand.


And I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


That's why elections matter.


That's what politics can be.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I have met recently.


And I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a five point plan.


I wanted to lead our country.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


It's not small, it's big.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


And I wanted a President who was smart.


And if it can change a room.


I knew he could be that President.


And I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


So I start joining in the chant.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


This is a family issue.


But it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa headquarters in 2008.


But I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


You'll give up on the change we've fought for.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


I went shopping at some stores in Midtown.


And in the 21st century.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


Let me say this publicly.


And tonight, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


I had in the first debate.


And I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews.


I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


You'll give up on the change we've fought for.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


And if it can change a city, it can change a room, it can change a nation.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules?


No, no, listen to this.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first lady.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


We've got to keep moving forward.


I say, How do you do?


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


Everyone, please take your seats otherwise Clint Eastwood will yell at them.


And that's why we've come too far to turn back now.


So why would you give him his vote?


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


But the truth is while I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


We understand that.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


We know what real change looks like.


In an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


Ready to go.


I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


And the woman, her name was Edith Childs she became a celebrity, and she was written up in The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


Tomorrow, all across this state, all across this state, all across this state, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


And it shouldn't.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job, or a roof over their heads when they come home.


And I am so proud of you guys.


Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


That's one thing we agree on.


There may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change.


Thank you so much.


I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


And what the protectors of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


I want us to control more of our own energy, cut oil imports in half, create thousands of clean energy jobs.


This is an economic issue.


We have been there.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


We've got more road to travel.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


That's what change is, Iowa.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us rich.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


Thank you so much.


They'll always have a seat at the table.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


None of this will add to the deficit.


You'll give up on the fight.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


To make sure their voices are heard.


We can't go back to that.


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


It's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


I gave him a stroke.


But the truth is while I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


A state, it can change a room.


By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock, resolve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.


Nice to meet you.


And if it can change a state, it can change the world.


Tomorrow, from the granite of New Hampshire to the Rockies of Colorado, from the coastlines of Florida to Virginia's rolling hills, from the valleys of Ohio to these Iowa fields we will keep America moving forward.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


Everyone, please take your seats otherwise Clint Eastwood will yell at them.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.


You'll give up on the change we've fought for.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


We have been there.


He does smile when he says it, though.


And what we also know is that when we decide to make a difference, when Americans come together, determined to bring about change, nobody can stop us.


We're fired up.


That's why we pushed for it.


Why should this be hard?


Don't let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


It's like getting the band back together again.


He told folks he was the ideal candidate for the Tea Party.


And you're going to have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward.


The people who need a champion are the Americans whose letters I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


It's not always a smooth path.


And we know what our future requires.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


And the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us, and we walked in and there are about 20 people there.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.

I want to thank you.


Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


That's where we need to go forward.

An economist at the New York Times put it this morning, There's no jobs plan there's just a snow job on the American people.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


I've got work to do.


What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.

After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


I have never been more hopeful about America.

Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


I said okay.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


I could use my middle name.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.

He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.

This is true.


Nothing like it.


I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I may have.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


And I want to take this opportunity to say one thing to all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.

I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


I have listened to you.


To make sure their voices are heard.


And tonight, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future.


It's not always a straight line.


I am so proud of you guys.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


So we want to thank Bruce for everything that he's done for us.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


That's the principle we were founded on.


For example, I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift.


We can't go back to that.


No, no, listen to this.


I tell you what, you know what I believe.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


And you know what, you may not agree with every decision I've made Michelle doesn't.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


That's where we need to go.


And I am so proud of you guys.


That's not a deal I will make.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work?


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.

And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion.

Because our budget reflects our priorities and our values.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


That's what we fight for.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


But I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.

And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the grip of foreign oil.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests.


Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


And if you're willing to still stand with me tomorrow, if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


We have our own opinions.


A remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


It makes a difference.


And we flew in late I think we were coming from Iowa.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


And I have so many fond memories of this state the house parties in Sioux City and Cedar Rapids; celebrating Malia's birthday in Pella; and seeing my husband's face carved in butter.


I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


Turns out she's a city councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.


And she's looking at me, kind of peering at me, and she's grinning, smiling, looking happy.


That's why elections matter.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


A j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


And it shouldn't.


I'd love to see you, but I think in fact, I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


And it brought back some great memories because, some of you know, I went to school here in New York, had a wonderful experience here.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


And you know what Edith said?


I'm looking around.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


And so we drive, and we drive, and we drive.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education where we recruit new teachers, train new workers, bring down tuition, so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education.


I'm asking for your vote.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win this election.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


Thank you so much.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


This is an economic issue.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to try.


There may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


That's not bipartisanship.


I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


We're not as cynical as the pundits believe.


God bless you.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Iraq, and we did.


I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


Mitt Romney is trying to give you a Sketchy Deal.


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


He told folks he was the ideal candidate for the Tea Party.


This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it.


That's the vision we share.


And if you're willing to stand with me, and make some phone calls with me, and make some phone calls with me, and knock on some doors with, get your friends to vote for me we will win Fairfax County again.


Where's that pep in your step?


It's not always a smooth path.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


We're not done yet on this journey.


This is true.


God bless the United States of America.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


I try to keep my promises.


That's the agenda we need.


I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


And, Iowa, you know me as well as anybody.


We've got more work to do.


A shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


And if it can change a state.


Why should this be hard?


It's not always a smooth path.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


To make sure their voices are heard.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


Thank you, America.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


And sometimes it's been hard.


You taught me to bet on hope.


We can't go back.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


And in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


We can't go back to that.


And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds.


I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you ready to go?


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


It moves forward because of you.


And Barack has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


And may God bless the United States of America.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


We have tried it.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


Four years ago, I gave him a stroke.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


Our fight for change goes on.


Michelle and I received.


And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests.


You inspired us.


I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


We've made real progress these past four years, our family has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


God bless your families.


If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


That's not change.


We have tried it.


Everyone, please take your seats otherwise Clint Eastwood will yell at them.


And the accommodations were a little different.


Our economy is recovering.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


We cannot be stopped.


It's in yours.


I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future.


But there's some principles you got to fight for.


Assembly lines are humming again.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education that Michelle and I received.


I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


God bless you.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


And may God bless the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


When the walls inside were bare, one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits.


We'll cut out spending we don't need.


I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


Home values are on the rise.


I'm feeling kind of fired up.


We said, why don't you come on up?


A case of Romnesia.


And she said, I tell you what, you know what I believe.


I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


Where's that golden smile?


I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America.


That's what we fight for.


Nice to meet you.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


She does it wherever she goes.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I have met recently.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


And I look at my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


Turns out she's a city councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


Why should this be hard?


We heard it the other night at the debate.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


I don't think your boss should decide what's best for your health and safety.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


And you know what Edith said?


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is playing by the same rules?


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


And if you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're Democrats, or Republicans, or independents the kind of Iowa leaders you've always had and Christie Vilsack, and Tom Harkin, and Leonard Boswell and Bruce Braley, and my great friends, Tom Miller and Mike Fitzgerald.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


But all of you are family.


So by the time I'm in the car I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


We can't go back.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


Freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care, or denied affordable coverage just because you beat cancer.


I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


No, no, listen to this.


That's what we're fighting for.


And it shouldn't.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


The New York Times.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


And you welcomed me and Michelle into your homes.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


And I knew that I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


We got bin Laden.


Don't let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


I want to thank you.


We're not done yet on this journey.


But I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in 2008.


Now suddenly he's saying, what, who, me?


And we called up Edith Childs.


And, Iowa, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


It's not small, it's big.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


That's who we are.


A shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


We can't go back to that.


So we may have different political perspectives, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions to push us back.


I ask you to sustain that hope.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


You know I tell the truth.


That's the vision we share.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


We will do it, because while we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


That's what change is, Iowa.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


And you're going to have a very big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years.


That's what change is, Iowa.


But those were tough fights.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


And, Iowa, you taught me to bet on you.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


Are you for making sure that laws enforce that basic principle?


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go!


And that's why we've come too far to turn back now.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


They'll always have access and influence.


I want to thank you all for being here tonight.


I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


And during our rallies, this became a chant, and we'd have signs saying Fired up, Ready to go.


Home values are on the rise.


A big round of applause for the great introduction and the work she does.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


And, Iowa, you know me as well as anybody.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


We can't go back.


To make sure their voices are heard.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.


Turns out she's a city councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.


I'm so proud to lead as your president.


But I'm running for President.


And we kept on going.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to keep believing in me.


The laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community college she needs a champion.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


He has just been tremendous.


And we know what our future requires.


Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


Assembly lines are humming again.


This is a family issue.


God bless you.


I've got a lot more fight left in me.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


I wish I could use my middle name.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


And we go to our next stop, and for the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace, even though people still couldn't pronounce my name, I felt good.


Moving this country forward begins with you.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education that Michelle and I received.


Home values are on the rise.


I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunities and new security for the middle class.


The people of Iowa understand that.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


It makes a difference.


Are you fired up?


Are we going to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I have met recently.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


Why should this be hard?


That's why I need you, Iowa.


But I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


That's what change looks like.


And, Iowa, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the months of campaigning, after all the rallies, after the millions of dollars of ads, it all comes down to you.


And Barack has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


And if it can change a city.


It's a choice between two different visions of America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


A country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


Four more years!


When the heat didn't work for the first week or so some of you brought hats and gloves for the staff.


That's what we believe.


The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote.


I'm President, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


I've got work to do.


And, by the way for all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank you.


We've got more road to travel.


She said, I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


This is true.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


You know I tell the truth.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


She does it wherever she goes.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


The stock market has nearly doubled 401s are starting to recover.


And finally I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no one who fights for this country's freedom should have to fight for a job, or a roof over their heads when they come home.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


This is my meeting.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


I learned from that experience.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


She's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


And in the 21st century.


Moving this country forward begins with you.


Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.


Against all odds, we did.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us rich.


God bless the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


That's what we're fighting for.


It's not small, it's big.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


A first home or send their kid to college they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


And if it can change a nation, it can change a room, it can change a state, it can change a nation.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


That's who we are.


I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa headquarters in 2008.


And Barack has been truly blessed truly blessed by all of the love and support and prayers that we have received from every corner of this country.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like, no matter where you are, no matter what we look like or where you love.


And for four years, that's exactly what he's done.


In a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa headquarters in 2008.


I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


Mitt is his middle name.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


And I sure don't think any politician should decide.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


We have tried it.


We have been there.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


And finally I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


But if you ever get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win this election.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work?


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


Turns out she's a city councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


I got a powerful reminder of this myself on our last campaign.


Thank you very much.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


Against all odds, we did.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


It's in yours.


And so we drive, and we drive.


I promise you, so have I.


And so we were getting kind of sentimental.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


We've got more work to do.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


Home values are on the rise.


I tell the truth.


I have so many fond memories of this state the house parties in Sioux City and Cedar Rapids; celebrating Malia's birthday in Pella; and seeing my husband's face carved in butter.


This is a family issue.


We've come too far to turn back now.


That's the principle we were founded on.


That's why we pushed for it.


Home values are back on the rise.


A chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


You held caucus trainings.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


Romney has got his sales pitch.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


Now suddenly he's saying, what, who, me?


And during our rallies, this became a chant, and we'd have signs saying Fired up, Ready to go.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


That's not just a health issue, it's an economic issue.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


I've got work to do.


And we kept on going.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


It makes a difference.


Manufacturing is coming home.


And if it can change a state.


That's the agenda you need.


Because our budget reflects our priorities and our values.


I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


Thank you, America.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


But now that we're 18 days out from the election, Mr.


These poor kids, they weren't prepared.


I'm ready to go.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


I hear the voice Fired up.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


Our economy is recovering.


I wish I could use my middle name.


I wanted someone we could trust someone who would always, always tell us the truth even when it's hard.


It's not always a smooth path.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


We're not going to kick a kid off of Head Start just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


I took office.


That's what change looks like.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


We are moving forward.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


He needs a champion.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut.


Are you for equal pay for equal work.


I don't have time just to be talking about it.


He's been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy.


An economist at the New York Times put it this morning, There's no jobs plan there's just a snow job on the American people.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States Barack Obama.


I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


And if it can change a state.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


I've seen for the past 23 years.


This is true.


That's why elections matter.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


Don't ever let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


And what the protectors of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


But all of you are family.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other.


And it shouldn't.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


That's the agenda we need.


You don't want that guy.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


We understand that.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq, and we did.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


And I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


You know I tell the truth.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


Thank you so much.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out they don't need another champion in Washington.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


That's why we're not done.


Where's that pep in your step?


And in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work?


They say, Fired up.


But we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has with that determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together.


Are you fired up?


I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.


Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years.


I want to hire more teachers in math and science, train 2 million workers at community colleges, bring down the cost of college tuition.


That's where we need to go.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


It moves forward because of you.


It's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


He can't tell you.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States Barack Obama.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


We rise or fall as one nation and as one people.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


I'd say, Are you ready to go?


Virginia, right here in America.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


Sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


You taught me to bet on hope.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


He told folks he was the ideal candidate for the Tea Party.


I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his.


I met her at some function where nobody knew me, nobody could pronounce my name.


That's what change is, Iowa.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


That's what we fight for.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


That's why I need you, Iowa.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq is over.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


That's what we're fighting for.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


I've come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to take your advice.


Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign.


So why would you give him his vote?


Let me say this publicly.


I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


That's where we need to go forward.


And we said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.


And I said, What?


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


And it turns out that Greenwood is several hours away from everyplace else.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


He needs a champion.


I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


This is my meeting.


That's where we need to go forward.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


And it brought back some great memories because, some of you know, I went to school here in New York, had a wonderful experience here.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


I want to finish the job.


And you've made me a better president.


I first showed up in Iowa.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long.


I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


We're ready to go.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


And if it can change a nation.


So for the next few minutes, she just keeps on saying Fired up.


And the accommodations were a little different.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


I used to prepare for the first debate.


But it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


The single most powerful force in our democracy is you.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


So that's a big relief.


Don't let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the fight.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


We are moving forward.


We will win Virginia again.


God bless you.


It's a choice between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


We're not done yet on this journey.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


I've got to knock on some doors with, get your friends to vote for me we will win Fairfax County again.


That's the agenda you need.


That's the agenda we need.


I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best the best ever some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


I'm wet and I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


Where's that pep in your step?


I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


That's not change.


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


And finally I get dressed, I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


It's not always a smooth path.


We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.


Are we going to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like, no matter where you are, no matter what we look like or where you love.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


One voice can change a room, it can change a room, it can change the world.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


But I tell you what, you know what I believe.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


But I'm running for President.


We will win Virginia again.


This is true.


But I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


We can't go back to that.


Four more years!


You know where I stand.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


They say, Fired up.


What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also.


And I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


I don't think your insurance company gets to decide what care you should get.


I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


And I look at my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


And I'm dragging my bags to my room.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions trying to stop us.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


But when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace.


That's where we need to go.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion.


The single most powerful force in our democracy is you.


We believe in a generous America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


I've seen for the past 23 years.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


I've never been more hopeful about our future.


We'll finish what we started.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


America who we are; what we believe; what we care about.


We've got the scars to prove it.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is playing by the same rules?


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


Assembly lines are humming again.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


And we know what our future requires.


So I'm trying to drink it all in.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


Now, this extends to other issues.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States Barack Obama.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


I knew he could be that President.


And she's dominating the room.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


I'd say, Are you ready to go?


I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


And she just had one question for you, and that is Are you fired up?


I go downstairs and I'm walking out to the car, and my umbrella blows open and I'm soaked.


I don't hear a lot going on.


And in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work?


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


Manufacturing is coming home.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education where we recruit new teachers, train new workers, bring down tuition, so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And we've seen over the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


I'm not just talking about changing parties.


I met her at some function where nobody knew me, nobody could pronounce my name.


And we will do it.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


I want every child to have the same chance at a great education that Michelle and I received.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


But I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


That's not bipartisanship.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


I want to finish the job.


God bless these United States.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


You showed up at campaign offices here in Des Moines and offices all over the state.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


And we said, why don't you come on up?


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.


Four more years!


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


But those were tough fights.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And tonight, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about America.


No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together.


I have to admit it can be a grind.


I've seen for the past 23 years.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what we look like or where we come from or who we love.


This is true.


It makes a difference.


He has just been tremendous.


It's out of my hands now.


I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


He's fought for our seniors, so that they can give the benefits they earned and the respect they deserve.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Against all odds, we did.


I've got to turn out the vote.


And it's really just a one point plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


Home values are on the rise.


I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.


That's why we pushed for it.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


Our fight for change goes on.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to try.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


I have to admit some things have changed since then.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote.


That's what change looks like.


That's not just a health issue, it's an economic issue.


God bless you.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


Michelle, I have never loved you more.


I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


Our fight goes on because America has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules?


I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


We've got to keep moving forward.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


I knew that I wanted a President with a steady character, with deep compassion and strong convictions.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


To make sure your voices are heard.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


This same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade the same philosophy that got us into this mess.


And I have to say, there's nothing like seeing The Boss in person.


You know I tell the truth.


But the truth is while I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


And we know what our future requires.


He and his family and his team, they've just been amazing.


I have to admit some things have changed since then.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


If he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance, you wouldn't give him a dime.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


Against all odds, we did.


I'm running for President.


I wanted a President who was smart.


This should be a no brainer.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


And, Iowa, you know me as well as anybody.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


Nothing like it.


But all of you are family.


That's not bipartisanship.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


We need to keep moving this country forward.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


You held caucus trainings.


And we've seen over the last four years.


They say, Fired up.


I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


That's what it's called.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


And what we also know is that change isn't easy.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


And, by the way, we have to fix that.


For four years, Barack has been fighting to give every single one of us a fair shot at that great American Dream, no matter what we look like or where you love.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


I could use my middle name.


Where's that golden smile?


But all of you are family.


If the price of peace in Washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid, or get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


And I'd see my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


You know where I stand.


She's about 60 years old; looks like she just came from church she got a big church hat.


Mitt Romney is trying to give you a Sketchy Deal.


You don't want that guy.


And I look at my staff, and I'd say, Are you fired up?


That's what makes America great.


So, take note, gentlemen.


He has stayed true to himself, and with your help, he's worked day after day to make this country better, to move it forward.


We've got more road to travel.


It's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating.


One point folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


And you know what Edith said?


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


When the next President and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.


And may God bless the United States of America, the best is yet to come.


But I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq.


Where's that golden smile?


But that common bond is where we must begin.


And the accommodations were a little different.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


Back then we didn't fly on Air Force One.


Assembly lines are humming again.


I'm not ready to give up on the fight.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for four years or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class.


A five point plan.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


And, by the way for all the young people out here, Obamacare has already allowed nearly 7 million young adults under the age of 26 to sign up to stay on their parent's plans.


So we may have different political perspectives, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


I was describing Barack.


We have been there.


Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


That's why we do this.


I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


You marched with us at the Jefferson Jackson dinner.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


I felt really well rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


Four more years!


I've got work to do.


Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.


We'll finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win this election.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


And it turns out that Greenwood is several hours away from everyplace else.


After losing 800, 000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses have now added over 5 million new jobs.


We've got the scars to prove it.


But that doesn't mean your work is done.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


I signed into office.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


It is an honor and a privilege to serve this nation just know that.


I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


We can't go back to that.


I asked her for her endorsement.


And we brought that to Iowa.


I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


But to wage that fight on behalf of American families, I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


They'd say, We're fired up.


I want to thank you.


That's one thing we agree on.


And Barack has been truly blessed to have all of you by his side as we have worked together to bring that change we can believe in.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


Moving this country forward begins with you.


And the accommodations were a little different.


I've come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote.


To Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a very big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


And I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews.


That's one thing we agree on.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


We have been there.


That's not change.


Now, the choice you make is not just between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


That's what we're fighting for.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


We will win Virginia again.


I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


I first showed up in Iowa.


And I knew that I wanted a President who was smart.


There may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change.


The people who need a champion are the Americans whose letters I read late at night after a long day in the office; the men and women I meet on the campaign trail every day.


Freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance.


And I have to admit it can be a grind.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


That's the agenda you need.


We're fired up.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


You'll give up on the fight.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States Barack Obama.


I want to thank you all for being here tonight.


And in the 21st century.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like, who you love, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class.


This law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than 20 million women, with no co pay, no deductible, no out of pocket cost, because I do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


That's where we need to go.


We have our own opinions.


This law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care because I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


And we said, why don't you come on up?


I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


Eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth.


It makes a difference.


We can't go back.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


And Edith Childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


And in between, I'm making phone calls, asking people for support.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead to our final debate on Monday.


If you say you're for equal pay for equal work?


And in the 21st century.


We've got to keep moving forward.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


We're not done yet on this journey.


We're not done yet on this journey.


No man should want his wife, or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job.


I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.


Where's that golden smile?


Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make not just a choice between two candidates or parties.


Governor Romney has got his sales pitch.


Sasha and Malia before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.


We've doubled the production of clean energy.


I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


God bless you.


To Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


He needs a champion.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


The Boss in person.


So, take note, gentlemen.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


Where's that pep in your step?


And I look at my staff, and they just shrug their shoulders.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


Instead of subsidizing oil company profits, I want to thank you all for being here tonight.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


It's out of my hands now.


And at the time, I was still competing in South Carolina it was one of the early primary states.


So I start joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant, and my staff starts joining in the chant.


You said, Yes, we can and we did.


Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.


And if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win Iowa.


These poor kids, they weren't prepared.


In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


I have never been more hopeful about America.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


He can't tell you.


Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me.


It's not always a straight line.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


We've got the scars to prove it.


In 2008, we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


To make sure their voices are heard.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


I walked in, and I'm looking around.


God bless the United States of America.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


And I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


After some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


When we had calls to make, teachers and nurses showed up after work, already bone tired, but staying anyway, late into the night.


I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


I try to keep my promises.


And we've seen over the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


We believe in a generous America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.


And, Iowa, you know me as well as anybody.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.


I look around, I turned behind me there's this small woman.


We've got more work to do.


I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


It moves forward because of you.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, the status quo in Washington, they are powerful and they have fought us every step of the way.


I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens.


And we said, why don't you come on up; we'll fly you up from South Carolina and you can do this chant one more time, just for old good time sake.


That's what makes America great.


I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


Tomorrow it's back to campaigning.


We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


We've come too far to turn back now.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


In on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


You said, Yes, we can.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


This is an economic issue.


A place for everybody.


I have seen this spirit at work in America.


We've got to keep moving forward.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions to push us back.


It moves forward because of you.


You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


That's not bipartisanship.


I'll ever do for me.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


Sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of memories.


I want to hire more teachers in math and science, train 2 million workers at community colleges, bring down the cost of college tuition.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


The autoworker who was laid off, thought the plant would never reopen, and is now back on the job, filled with pride and dignity, building a great car, building America he needs a champion.


And I think I had a little bit of wine during dinner, because right away I said okay.


When Governor Romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in Massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception, when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


Well, you made this promise to go to Greenwood, and it's several hours away.


We knew we were coming back to Des Moines for the last campaign rally I'll ever do for me.


We've got the scars to prove it.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


You'll hear the determination in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


We got every dime back from the banks that we used to rescue those banks.


That's where we need to go.


You said, Yes, we can and we did.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests.


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


Thank you so much.


Are you fired up?


From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


Ready to go!


Thank you so much.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.


And if you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're Democrats, or Republicans, or independents the kind of Iowa leaders you've always had and Christie Vilsack, and Tom Harkin, and Leonard Boswell and Bruce Braley, and my great friends, Tom Miller and Mike Fitzgerald.


I told you I ran because your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq.


You taught me to bet on you.


And tomorrow, we get the chance to finish what we started, she's pretty sure we'll win this election.


I think this office had just finally gotten the heat turned on.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


I'm so proud of my husband.


And your faces gave me new hope for this country's future, and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day I set foot in the Oval Office.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care you might have a case of Romnesia.


I'm ready to go.


A nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.


Four more years!


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


That won't change after tonight.


And Iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.


And we pull up to a small field house, and I walked in, and I'm looking around.


The folks at the top in this country, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


We're not done yet on this journey.


Virginia, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the Square Deal, the Fair Deal.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


I mean, as you know this is a pretty emotional time for us, because this is the final event of my husband's final campaign.


In 2008, we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.


It's in yours.


This is my meeting.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change is.


I took office.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


I promised to cut taxes for middle class families, and I have.


I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


That's what we're fighting for.


Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


Our fight for change goes on.


I started envisioning the kind of person that I wanted to lead our country.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


And we've seen over the last four years.


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


And I'm making my way around the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.


I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.


And if you're willing to get your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers to the polls tomorrow, if you're willing to work hard, willing to take responsibility.


But what we also know is that change isn't easy.


Let's focus on making sure that we're building America.


And if it can change a city.


I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors on Election Day I don't have time just to be talking about it.


We have tried it.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


That's what change is, Iowa.


Because our budget reflects our priorities and our values.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


Freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


We can't go back.


I don't have time just to be talking about it.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system, they spent millions trying to stop us.


Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat.


And you know, Iowa, I try to keep my promises.


I'm talking about changing our politics.


That's why elections matter.


None of this will add to the deficit.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


Four more years!


Assembly lines are humming again.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


So we want to thank Bruce for everything that he's done for us.


I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


Ready to go.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change is.


I don't know what's going on.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


So why would you give him his vote?


I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


But I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


I have met recently.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


Change is a country where every American has a shot at a great education that Michelle and I received.


That's what change looks like.


I sure don't think any politician should decide.


That's what change looks like.


We've got more road to travel.


And that shows you what one voice can do.


The American auto industry is back.


Now, this extends to other issues.


A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


That's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long.


Everybody has got a chance to make it if you try.


Where's that pep in your step?


Freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care, or denied affordable coverage just because you beat cancer.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


They're wondering, what's he thinking?


And I'm startled, and I don't know what's going on.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


And we called up Edith Childs.


And at a certain point, all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes down to each of us, as citizens.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


Folks in Iowa, I know you may have heard this story but it was early in the primaries, and we were still way down in the polls.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


That's what change is, Iowa.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


And I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.


I meet on the campaign trail every day.


We know what real change is.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to stand with me, and knock on some doors.


We know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


To make sure their voices are heard.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us rich.


I meet on the campaign trail every day.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds.


The teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks, digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies, not always feeling like she's got the support she needs, but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life she needs a champion.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


A half million new jobs.


Believe me, we still talk about that at Christmas.


He can't tell you.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


He talks about freedom, but freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


That's what politics can be.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


Change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was in office.


And I want to take this opportunity to say one thing to all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank you.


Thank you to Al and Ann.


Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


And in 18 days, you're going to have a very big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years.


And somehow I feel pretty good.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight.


And of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience.


I said okay.


It's like getting the band back together again.


You can make it here in America if you're willing to try.


I've made Michelle doesn't.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


And I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office.


And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me, because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones.


And it turns out she's famous throughout the area.


And, Iowa, that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


And if it can change a city.


I'm honored to be with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


They don't know what to do.


That's the that's the future we hope for.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown.


We can't go back.


I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


You taught me to bet on you.


In 18 days, you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess, or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess.


We've got your Congressman here Gerry Connolly in the house.


If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


Thank you so much.


We got every dime back from the banks that we used to rescue those banks.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


And I have so many fond memories of this state the house parties in Sioux City and Cedar Rapids; celebrating Malia's birthday in Pella; and seeing my husband's face carved in butter.


And if it can change a state.


We've come too far to let our hearts grow faint.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


I know he's called him severely he's called himself severely conservative, but there's nothing conservative about a government that prevents a woman from making her own health care decisions.


But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.


Nothing like it.


And more than anything else, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow.


I don't have time just to be talking about it.


I hear the voice Fired up.


I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


So why would you give him his vote?


You know where I stand.


Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it.


Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


Tomorrow, all across this state, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way, we have to fix that.


I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


That's one thing we agree on.


Romney; Governor Cuomo; Mayor Bloomberg; Senator Schumer; all the distinguished guests who are here.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


I've seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb and in those Seals who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.


You'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every American.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


You know where I stand.


Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


Used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built although he really did not build that.


Ready to go!


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


And I have to admit some things have changed since then.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the fight.


That's what it's called.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


They say, Fired up.


I learned from that experience.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


And when the voice says, Fired up, they all say, Ready to go.


We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.


Spoiler alert We got bin Laden.


I've made Michelle doesn't.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


We've got more work to do.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


It's not always a straight line.


We know what real change looks like.


A warming planet.


That's not a deal I will make.


This is my meeting.


And after all we've been through together, after all that we fought through together, we cannot give up on change now.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


We had been campaigning non stop, traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us strong.


But I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


That's what we're fighting for.


It's out of my hands now.


You taught me to bet on you.


And everybody says Fired up, and she says she's Ready to go, and everybody else says Ready to go.


And it turns out that Greenwood is several hours away from everyplace else.


He needs a champion.


Sometimes it's been frustrating.


And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage; people from both parties can come together come together to support a worthy cause.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


Four more years!


He wants you to believe that somehow he'll create 12 million jobs, cut taxes by 5 trillion, even though it favors the wealthiest Americans.


And over these past four years.


I want to take this opportunity to say one thing to all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years those of you who haven't done this just for me, but for each other for a laid off family member, for a sick child, for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years.


When she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events, she does this chant of hers.


And I said, What?


And this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in 2008.


In other words, their bet is on cynicism.


And that's why we've come too far to turn back now.


And we won't stop until every voice and every last vote is counted.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, at around midnight.


And I open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in The New York Times.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


We will win Virginia again.


And so we land in Greenwood, South Carolina.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


But those were tough fights.


I tell you what, you know what I believe.


And we called up Edith Childs.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing parties.


That's why I'm asking for your vote.


As long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there's a single American who wants a job but can't find one; as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind; as long as there's a child anywhere in Des Moines, anywhere in Iowa, anywhere in this country languishing in poverty, barred from opportunity our work isn't done.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


It's not always a straight line.


I've heard some people say, Barack, you're not as young as you used to be.


I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


That's what makes America great.


I tell you what, you know what I believe.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


That's what we're fighting for.


That's not bipartisanship.


They'll always have access and influence.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century.


So you did all this crazy stuff.


Are you fired up?


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same rules.


And if it can change a room, it can change the world.


It's just a remarkable thing, the way our democracy works.


But I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


We've seen a man of honor and integrity who knows what he believes and stays true to his values.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


We understand that.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


We have tried it.


None of this will add to the deficit.


So I asked her for her endorsement.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


And over these past four years.


That's not just a health issue, it's an economic issue.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or how you started out, what you look like or where you love.


Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


Freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care, or denied affordable coverage just because you beat cancer.


And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


That's the principle we were founded on.


I'm ready to go.


So we want to thank Bruce for everything that he's done for us.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


It's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names.


And what we also know is that when we decide to make a difference, when Americans come together, determined to bring about change, nobody can stop us.


When the heat didn't work for the first week or so some of you brought hats and gloves for the staff.


I visit cities and towns across our great country, and I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


Four years after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


He's fought so women get equal pay and students can afford college.


I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about America.


And I am so proud of you guys.


I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


A young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


It's not always a smooth path.


So that means that we need to reelect the man who has been fighting for us every single day my husband, the love of my life the President of the United States.


And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth.


I've got a lot more fight left in me.


And I knew that I wanted a President driven not by politics or which way the wind is blowing, but by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all Americans.


Al and Ann.


And they're all kind of wet, too, and they don't look very excited to see me.


Why aren't they putting on The Voice?


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign.


You want a President who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court of the United States.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


I have never loved you more.


To Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs.


You took this campaign and you made it your own.


The people of Iowa understand that.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


Our fight for change goes on.


It's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us to policies more suited to the 1950s.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can and we did.


To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best the best ever some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.


That's the agenda we need.


And today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs.


I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift.


Now, this extends to other issues.


Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate and I happen to be one of them.


But as long as I'm President, we're not going to take your advice.


And when the cynics said we couldn't, you said Yes, we can.


And, Iowa, in 2008, your voice changed the world.


We heard it the other night at the debate.


That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president.


I could use my middle name.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to take your advice.


As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.


Change is turning the page on a decade of war is ending.


Thank you very much.


I'm mad and I'm still kind of sleepy.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.


You know where I stand.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


Our economy is recovering.


For months, I have heard his songs played at our rallies.


As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate.


Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that no one who fights for this country's freedom should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home.


You'll give up on the change we've fought for.


And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


Freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


And in the 21st century.


I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.


That's why you elected me in 2008.


And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.


That's why we do this.


So the economy is the dominant issue.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


Why should this be hard?


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


For all those who are young at heart but not young in years, it's already saved millions of seniors on Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine.


You know where I stand.


Al Qaeda is on the run.


The single most powerful force in our democracy is you.


I ask you to sustain that hope.


Michelle and I received.


And just as I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


I don't think your boss should decide what's best for your health and safety.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.


I really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there.


And may God bless the United States of America.


Now, the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties.


I told you I ran because your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long.


I set foot in the Oval Office.


I used to talk about change.


America's never been about what can be done by us together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government.


And for four years, we have all seen what I've seen for the past 23 years.


But I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


We have been there.


I've become more accustomed to these now.


You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


That's not a deal I will make.


That's the agenda you need.


So a few hours later, I wake up and I'm feeling terrible.


Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular governor, and who knows what it's like to run a major Northeastern state, and who could very well be president someday and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo.


The New York Times.


And if it can change a city, it can change a state.


I've got a plan and it's a real plan, not a five point plan.


We've got to keep moving forward.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


But we have to give some love up for Bruce Springsteen.


We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up.


This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.


An economist at the New York Times put it this morning, There's no jobs plan there's just a snow job on the American people.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.


And I take a shower and get some coffee, and I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


It's out of my hands now.


I'm just kidding I'm trying to make Axelrod sweat a little bit.


And they'd say, We're ready to go.


And you've made me a better president.


You'll give up on the change we've fought for.


That's the principle we were founded on.


But no matter how many times Governor Romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea, he refuses to say.


We will win Virginia again.


And tonight, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.


Can everybody please give Cecile a big round of applause for the great introduction and the work she does.


That's one thing we agree on.


Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


In 18 days, you can let them turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants, and gays, and women, or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place.


It's not always a smooth path.


Al Qaeda is on the run.


And that's why we've come too far to turn back now.


So, take note, gentlemen.


Now is the time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids, and train all our workers, and to create new jobs, and rebuild our roads, and bring back our troops, and care for our veterans, and broaden opportunity, and grow our middle class, and restore our democracy and make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job, or a roof over their head when they come home.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


We repealed don't ask, don't tell, to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love.


Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year.


We cannot be stopped.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote.


The people of Iowa understand that.


Why should this be hard?


And, Iowa, I'm not ready to give up on the change we've fought for.


After a few minutes, I'm feeling kind of fired up.


And we know what our future requires.


We didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out.


Now suddenly he's saying, what, who, me?


Don't let anybody tell you your voice doesn't matter.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


I have to admit some things have changed since then.


We've made real progress these past four years.


We're not as cynical as the pundits believe.


I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


In 18 days, you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out, or you can say let's end the Afghan war responsibly; let's bring our troops home.


I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I may have.


That's who we are.


You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.


So it's about a month later, and I'm traveling back to South Carolina.


I'm certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


And if it can change a nation.


But all of you are family.


I'm running for President, so I do what I'm supposed to do and I'm shaking hands, I say, How do you do?


Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate we won't spend a whole lot of memories.


That's what it's called.


We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong.


But Paul Ryan assured me that we've only been running for two hours and 50 something minutes.


And more than anything else, I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


The Wall Street Journal and folks did news stories on her.


It's out of my hands now.


I happen to be one of them.


I could use my middle name.


I'm not just talking about changing parties.


Insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.


In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question, what are we doing here?


We cannot be stopped.


Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate.


This is true.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


And, by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


So that's a big relief.


All those kids in inner cities, small farm towns kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs, diplomats or even a President they need a champion in Washington, because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do.


I mean, as you know this is a pretty emotional time for us, because this is the final event of my husband's final campaign.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


A higher purpose that are on display this evening.


It's been four years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner.


You don't want that guy.


America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world.


And Barack has been truly blessed to have all of you by his side as we have worked together to bring that change we can believe in.


Our economy is recovering.


This is a family issue.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.


He told folks he was the ideal candidate for the Tea Party.


And that's why, when we talk about change, we know what real change looks like because we've fought for it.


And, by the way, that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform, a.


Now, anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter, know this My opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office, says he'd do it on day one.


What he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions trying to stop us.


This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


The cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff, working overtime in a hotel in Des Moines or Vegas, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college they need a champion.


And what we also know is that when we decide to make a difference, when Americans come together, determined to bring about change, nobody can stop us.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church.


You taught me to bet on you.


We know what real change looks like.


And we said, why don't you come on up?


We know what real change looks like.


There are times where you've got to take a stand.


We know full well that if he gets the chance, he'll rubber stamp the agenda of this Republican Congress the second he takes office.


We passed laws to end taxpayer funded Wall Street bailouts for good.


Now, here's the end of the story, though.


I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


And so we drive, and we drive, and we drive, and we drive, and we drive, and we drive, and we drive, and we drive.


Now, the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this; Iowans, you guys pay attention the choice you make is not just between two candidates or two parties, but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love.


We have seen an honest man who knows the facts and always gives it to us straight.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


Where's that pep in your step?


And what the protectors of the status quo in Washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling.


I had my worries and my fears, I also realized that this decision affected not only me as a wife and a mother, but as a voter, as an American.


We have our own opinions.


We will win Virginia again.


I want to use the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to pay down our deficit, put our people back to work right here, doing some nation building here at home.


And soon, they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women.


In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.


You'll get fed up with the dysfunction.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America.


He may not have noticed, we're in the 21st century, a woman deserves equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work you might have Romnesia.


We can't go back to that.


And more than anything else, I want to thank every American who participated in this election.


But I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


But, Iowa, you know me as well as anybody.


We reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world.


Get him a little nervous.


That's what politics can be.


Remember, a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in 2007, 2008, and I used to talk about change.


That's how we strengthen the middle class.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Democrats, Republicans, who believe we've all got something to contribute; that we all deserve a shot at our own American Dream.


And you've made me a better president.


He's rescued our economy from the brink of collapse and saved the auto industry.


To make sure their voices are heard.


But I also said I'm not just talking about changing presidents.


You helped teach me that, here in Iowa.


And that's why I am so thrilled to be here in Iowa tonight because long before most people even knew his name, you all saw what I saw.


We know what real change looks like.


This was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help.


To Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs.


That's why I need you, Iowa.


But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough.


He's passed historic health reform ended the war in Iraq, and we did.


I want to thank you.


I may have.


And they're all kind of wet, too, and they don't look very excited to see me.


Our economy is recovering.


One voice can change a room, it can change the world.


So, take note, gentlemen.


And we will do it.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood, or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor, or elderly, or disabled I won't pay that price.


Sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


And the more I thought about it, the more I knew in my heart that I was describing Barack.


And we drive out and it's still raining, but it doesn't seem so bad.


And that's why we wanted to come here to Iowa tonight because truly this is where it all began, right here.


We've seen a man whose strength and resolve to build a better tomorrow has never wavered, never.


A future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate.


That's how we'll keep moving forward.


I'd love to see you, but I think we can still win North Carolina, so I'm taking a crew into North Carolina to knock on doors until our fingers are numb.


I said okay.


And we'll remind the world why the United States of America.


They say, Ready to go.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


Because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform, the war in Iraq, and we did.


Thank you very much.


When folks who don't actually work for Governor Romney start crunching the numbers, it turns out the tax plan doesn't add up, jobs plan doesn't create jobs, deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit.


And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.


Tomorrow, all across this country, we will line up and vote in libraries and community centers, in school gyms.


And finally we get to Greenwood although you don't know you're in Greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around.


That is truly what made the difference back in those early days when I wasn't so sure about this whole process; back when I was still wondering what it would mean for our girls and our family if Barack got the chance to serve as President.


And I ask you to sustain that hope.


And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.


And I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.


You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.


We're going to make calls until our voices are hoarse.


Now, I believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class, who are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love.


I felt good.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


You've seen a lot of me these last six years.


Four years ago, I told you we'd end the war in Afghanistan we are.


These poor kids, they weren't prepared.


Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.


I'm about to walk into the room, one of my staf taps me on the shoulder to say, Excuse me, Senator I was a senator back then.


Change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing.


And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.


We're not as cynical as the pundits believe.


So this goes on for a few minutes.


I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.


We didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey.


Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I will have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home Is this happening again?


But, Iowa, we're here tonight because we've got more work to do.


That's okay, I'm still making the most of my time in the city.


In fact, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that I signed into office.


Four more years!


Are you for equal pay for equal work?


That's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years.


And that's why I'm running for a second term as President of the United States.


I have never been more hopeful about America.


I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


And we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room, and suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me Fired up.


That's what change is, Iowa.


I don't think your boss should decide what's best for your health and safety.


And I open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.


It's a choice between going back to the top of the world.


So, Virginia, the choice The choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear.


And I wanted a President who was smart.


When we tried and succeeded in reforming Wall Street, they spent millions to push us back.


We've got more road to travel.


Because this is where our movement for change began.


I have to admit it can be a grind.


I will never forget the kindness and warmth and love that you all showed me and my family, especially our girls.


It moves forward because of you.


And sometimes it's been hard.


So this is the last time that he and I will be onstage together at a campaign rally.


You know I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how.


I won't pay that price.


If he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance, you wouldn't give him a dime.


Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


Now, here's the thing, Iowa.


But Paul Ryan assured me that we've only been running for two hours and 50 something minutes.


You said, Yes, we can.


Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


When Governor Romney said we'd let he'd let Detroit go bankrupt, we said, we're not going to turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut.


Because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class.


They don't know what to do.


That's how our democracy is supposed to be.


It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.


But everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal.


We know what real change looks like.


Eighteen days, Virginia.


When we had a Steak Fry to march to, when we had a j j Dinner to fire up you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs.


I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.


In 2008, we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we're moving.


But those were tough fights.


8 year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.


That's what's at stake, Virginia.


All of it depends on you bringing your friend, or your neighbor, your coworker, your mom, your dad, your wife, your husband to the polls.


And you organized yourselves, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, county by county, starting a movement that spread across the country a movement made up of young and old, and rich and poor, and black and white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, abled, disabled we have a place for everybody.


A champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg this time around I gave him a stroke.


And I say, Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting.


I need you to still have some fight in you, too.


When Governor Romney says he's going to get rid of funding for Planned Parenthood What he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptive care, but for preventive care.


And then, on a cold January night, you stood up for Barack, because you knew that he would stand up for you.


Osama bin Laden is dead.


But that common bond is where we must begin.


She's pretty sure we'll win this election.


I hear the same thing everywhere I go honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle.


I tell you what, Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.


Actually, Mitt is his middle name.


We're ready to go.


You inspired us.


All of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow.


If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases man, you've definitely got Romnesia.


We are, and forever will be, the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.


Freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it.


I don't think a college student in Charlottesville or Blacksburg or Fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs.


You don't want that guy.


I've got a lot more fight left in me.


But we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has with that determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together.


I want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where Governor Romney is offering you a sketchy deal.


Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.


I try to keep my promises.


If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for small business owners we have, 18 times.


Our fight for change goes on.
